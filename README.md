# Bouncing-Ball-mains

Features
Ball bouncing physics: The ball moves and bounces off the edges of the window.
Gravity simulation (optional): Apply gravity to make the ball fall and bounce with decreasing height.
Collision detection: Detect when the ball hits the walls and reverse its direction accordingly.
Customizable ball properties: Adjust ball speed, size, elasticity (bounciness), and gravity.
Smooth animation: Real-time movement of the ball, with smooth and continuous updates.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
Pygame library (pip install pygame) or another framework for graphical simulations (such as JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas).
